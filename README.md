## ✨ Features
- Resume text preprocessing pipeline
- GRU model for job category classification
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## 🎯 Design decisions or assumptions
- GRU selected for handling sequential resume text due to efficient memory usage
- Labels encoded based on job category
- CSV format used for data due to project scope
- No database connectivity; data loaded directly into memory
